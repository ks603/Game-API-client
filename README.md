# **Project 2: Video Game Review (client side)**

This is the Front-end of project two.

# **Description**
For project number two I decided to do a video game review site. A user can sign up and
sign in and create a review for a video game. Once signed in they can also view reviews that other users made on games. The user will only be able to update or delete games that they created.

# **User Stories For Ticket**

- As a user I want to be able to sign up and sign in.

- As a user I want to be able to change password.

- As a user I want to be able to create and update games.

- As a user I want to be able to view other users games.

- As a user I want to be able to delete my own game.

- As a user I want to be able to sign out.

# **Technologies Used**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- handlebars

# **Unsolved Issues/Future**
- In the future I want to be able to search for games that way I can see if other users have made a review and if the game is recomended or not.
